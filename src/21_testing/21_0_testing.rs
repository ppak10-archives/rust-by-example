/*
 * Testing
 *
 * Rust is a programming language that cares a lot about correctness and it
 * includes support for writing software tests within the language itself.
 *
 * Testing comes in three styles:
 * * Unit testing.
 * * Doc testing.
 * * Integration testing.
 *
 * Also Rust has support for specifying additional dependencies for tests:
 * * Dev-dependencies
