/*
 * Documentation
 *
 * Use `cargo doc` to build documentation in `target/doc`.
 *
 * Use `cargo test` to run all tests (including documentation tests), and
 * `cargo test --doc` to only run documentation tests.
 *
 * These commands will appropriately invoke `rustdoc` (and `rustc`) as required.
 *
 * Doc comments
 *
 * Doc comments are very useful for big projects that require documentation.
 * When running `rustdoc`, these are the comments that get compiled into
 * documentation. They are denoted by a `///`, and support Markdown.

// To run the tests, first build the code as a library, then tell `rustdoc`
// where to find the library so it can link it into each doctest program:
//
// ```
// $ rustc doc.rs --crate-type lib
// $ rustdoc --test --extern doc="libdoc.rlib" doc.rs
// ```

/*
 * Doc attributes
 *
 * Below are a few examples of the most common `#[doc]` attributes used with
 * `rustdoc`.
 */

/* `inline`
 *
 * Used to inline docs, instead of linking out to separate page.
 *
 * ```
 * #[doc(inline)]
 * pub use bar::Bar;
 *
 * /// bar docs
 * mod bar {
 *   /// the docs for Bar
 *   pub struct Bar;
 * }
 * ```
 */

/*
 * `no_inline`
 *
 * Used to prevent linking out to separate page or anywhere.
 *
 * ```
 * // Example from libcore/prelude
 * #[doc(no_inline)]
 * pub use crate::mem::drop;
 * ```
 */

/*
 * `hidden`
 *
 * Using this tells `rustdoc` not to include this in documentation:
 * ```
 * // Example from the futures-rs library
 * #[doc(hidden)]
 * pub use self::async_await::*;
 * ```
 */

// For documentation, `rustdoc` is widely used by the community. It's what is
// used to generate the std library docs.
